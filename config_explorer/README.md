# Configuration Explorer

The configuration explorer is a library that helps find the most cost-effective, optimal configuration for serving models on llm-d based on hardware specification, workload characteristics, and SLO requirements.

This library provides the tooling for LLM serving such as
- Capacity planning:
  - for any LLM on Hugging Face, determine the per-GPU memory requirement for loading the model and serving requests, taking into account parallelism strategies
  - from workload characteristics in terms of max model length and concurrency, determine the KV cache memory requirement
- 🚧 Configuration sweep and recommendation (WIP)
  - given SLO requirements in terms of TTFT, TPOT, and throughput, visualize the optimal `llm-d` configuration, including Inference Scheduler and vLLM, for achieving the SLO
  - For unseen configurations, predict latency and throughput from a inference performance estimator


## Installation

* Requires python 3.11+
* Requires pip3

Currently, the core functionality is in the form of a Python module within `llm-d-benchmark`. In the future, we might consider shipping as a separate package depending on community interest.

1. (optional) Set up a Python virtual environment
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. The `config_explorer` package can be installed via `pip`

    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark.git
    ```

3. Invoke functions in the package via

    ```
    from config_explorer.capacity_planner import *
    ```


## Use

There are two ways to interact with the Configuration Explorer: via an experimental frontend or via a library.

### Frontend
A Streamlit frontend is provided to showcase the capabilities of the Configuration Explorer rapidly. Since the core functions are in a module, users may feel free to build their own frontend, such as a CLI, by making use of those functions.

Running the Streamlit frontend requires cloning the `llm-d-benchmark` repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark.git
pip install -r config_explorer/requirements-streamlit.txt
streamlit run config_explorer/Home.py
```

### Library
Users may import the functions like the following to use in their code after `pip install git+https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark.git`.

```
from config_explorer.capacity_planner import *
```

Here is a list of all the functions for the Capacity Planner:
